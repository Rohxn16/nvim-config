### Installation Process

1. Remove any pre existing configuration : `rm -rf ~/.config/nvim/*` and `rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim`
2. Clone the repository : `git clone https://github.com/Rohxn16/nvim-config ~/.config/nvim`
3. Open neovim and let it download the dependencies and exit it.
4. Open neovim again and in the command mode type `:MasonInstallAll` to install all the plugins. This should get everyting up and running.

** NOTE : I use my neovim for python development and competitive coding in c++ so I only have plugins for these languages installed, there is also a debugger installed for C++ which I don't use much but can definintely come in handy for some other users. **
